# A Privacy-Preserving Framework for Keyword-Based Document Retrieval
## Abstract:
Concerns about privacy have grown with the digitization of everyday life, especially as Internet services collect large amounts of personal data. If these records are exploited, search engines, which store user queries for individualized information retrieval, pose a serious privacy threat. For this reason, hiding search intent via query obfuscation has become a crucial approach in Private Web Search to protect user privacy. The lack of semantic meaning in the random searches produced by early obfuscation techniques reduced both privacy and retrieval value. Although recent developments such as proxy-based and scrambling techniques have improved privacy, they are still computationally expensive or vulnerable to data leakage. 

This study presents a novel query obfuscation technique that utilizes Large Language Models(LLMs). The proposed method ensures robustness to adversarial attacks. To further enhance privacy, the method considers the user's consecutive queries. This work aims to provide a utility and privacy-preserving query obfuscation schema that is robust to adversarial attacks by addressing the shortcomings of earlier methods.
